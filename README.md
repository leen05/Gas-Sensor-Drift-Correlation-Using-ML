# 🌫️ Gas Sensor Drift Prediction using XGBoost

This project focuses on predicting gas concentrations from sensor data while addressing the issue of **sensor drift** — a common problem in long-term gas sensing systems. The model is trained on preprocessed batch-wise data and uses **XGBoost**, a powerful and efficient gradient boosting algorithm.

## 📌 Description

Gas sensors tend to degrade over time due to environmental changes like temperature and humidity, causing inaccurate readings. This project tackles that problem by:

- Preprocessing raw sensor data from multiple batches
- Building an XGBoost regression model for gas concentration prediction
- Evaluating performance using metrics like MAE and RMSE
- Visualizing trends using heatmaps, histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots

This solution is useful in fields like environmental monitoring, industrial safety, and IoT-based gas detection systems.
